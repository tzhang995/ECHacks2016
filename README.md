# Electric City Hacks 2016
Our submission for Electric City Hackathon 2016 hosted by Major League Hacking

Getting on the public transit system is an everyday affair that students, seniors, and workers all depend on across major cities in the world. One of the major flaws in public transit system is the transfer system. The transfer system enforces people to use paper receipts when getting off and on different buses and trains en route to their final destination. This is both a huge inconvenience to travellers and wastes massive amounts of paper which can pollutes the environment. 

Welcome to our modern transit solution, eStamps. The paperless, eco-friendly way of using any transit system. Simply open eStamps, select the city that you are currently in, choose from a variety of payment options, and show your proof of payment to the conductor when you are onboard. No fumbling around for transfer receipts or small change - easy, convenient and eco-friendly. With a staggering 91% of the adult population owning a cellphone, and many cities, including Peterborough, wanting to be more technology reliant, we believe that eStamps will not only be feasible but there will be a huge demand for this application.

Soon public transit systems will have the eStamps of approval
