# ECHacks2016
Our submission for Electric City Hackathon 2016 hosted by Major League Hacking

The public transit, nearly every major city across the world has them. Students, seniors, everyday workers all use the magnificent system that is the public transit. Millions if not billions have relied on the public transportation around the world. But one of the flaws in this system is the transfer system. The transfer system enforces people to use paper transfers when going from bus to bus. This both wastes paper as well as create litter for our environment. This is where we come in. Welcome to our modern transit solution, eStamps. The paperless, eco-friendly way of using any transit system. Simply open eStamps, select the city that you are in currently, choose from a variety of payment options, and simply wave your proof of payment to the conductor when you are onboard. No fumbling around for transfer receipts or small change - easy, convenient and eco-friendly. With a staggering 91% of the adult population owning a cellphone and many cities, including Peterborough, turning more electrical everyday, we believe not only is this feasible but there will be a huge demand for this application. 

In the future, we plan on enabling bluetooth in our app so that all you require is a simple tap for the transit system to check if you have paid or not.

By using our application, millions of potential users will have a simple and efficient way of using the transit system, not only in Peterborough, but around the world.
